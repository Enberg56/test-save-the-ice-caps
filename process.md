**Comments while working**

For gdpr. It would be advisable to go through all these inputs. Are everyone of them activly used? Could the asking these questions detract from our main goal, the goal of obtaining donations.
With this in mind I'll do some alterations, since this document is a one sided conversation I'll be my boss.
Since we're creating a physical newsletter. Name and Address are the only personal information thats needed. But I'd advice let's also have a digital version. I know the marketing department might feel strongly about this but hear me out.
Let the customer choose. Some might not want a physical version, now instead of loosing these customers they can participate.
Our costs, It's highly likely the newsletter content are already digital. Then it likely won't cost us much.
Build trust, by only gathering information that the clients understand why we use it's easier, and faster, to trust.
I'll comment out some of the input fields.
